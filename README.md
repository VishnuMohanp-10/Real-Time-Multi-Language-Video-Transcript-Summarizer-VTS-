Real-Time Multi-Language Video Transcript Summarizer

Project Overview
Real-Time Multi-Language Video Transcript Summarizer is an AI-powered web application that extracts audio from uploaded videos, converts speech into text using advanced speech recognition models, and generates concise summaries from the transcript.
The system integrates speech recognition and natural language processing into a single workflow to provide efficient and structured understanding of long video content.

Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of video-based content such as lectures, webinars, interviews, meetings, and tutorials, extracting meaningful insights from long videos has become time-consuming and inefficient.
Key challenges include:
Watching lengthy videos to extract key information
Difficulty understanding videos in foreign languages
Manual note-taking and summarization
Lack of integrated tools for both transcription and summarization
This project addresses these challenges by automating the entire process from transcription to summarization.
Scope of the Project
The system provides the following functionalities:
Video upload interface
Audio extraction from video files
Speech-to-text conversion
Multi-language transcription support
Automatic text summarization
Display and storage of transcripts and summaries
Applications of this system include:
Educational content summarization
Corporate meeting documentation
Research and academic analysis
Media and news content analysis
Accessibility support for hearing-impaired users

Working Mechanism

The user uploads a video file.
Audio is extracted from the video.
A speech recognition model transcribes the audio into text.
The transcript is processed using an NLP-based summarization model.
The system generates a structured summary.
The transcript and summary are displayed to the user.
The pipeline ensures efficient processing and meaningful output generation.
Uniqueness and Contribution
This project differentiates itself from existing solutions in the following ways:
Integrates transcription and summarization into a single system
Supports multi-language processing
Provides an end-to-end automated workflow
Built as a deployable web application rather than a standalone script
Designed for real-world use cases such as education and corporate documentation
Most existing tools either focus only on transcription or require separate services for summarization. This project combines both processes into one unified system.
